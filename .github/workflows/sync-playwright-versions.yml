# This workflow automates the synchronization of Playwright versions for Dependabot pull requests.
# When Dependabot updates Playwright in package.json, this workflow:
# 1. Detects the version mismatch between package.json and other configuration files (Dockerfile, ci.yml).
# 2. Runs a script to update the versions in those files to match package.json.
# 3. Commits the changes to the Dependabot branch with a [dependabot-skip] message to avoid update loops.
