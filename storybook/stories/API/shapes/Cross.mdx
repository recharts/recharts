# Cross

The Cross is a shape that itself is not a valid child in any component.
It can be used to implement custom elements, returning it from within a

```jsx
<Customized component={<Cross {...crossProps} />} />
```

or other custom components (i.e. shape of a bar)

<ArgTypes of={CrossStories} sort="requiredFirst" />
