# Brush

<Meta of={ComponentStories} />

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.API} layout="padded" />

## Description

<p>
  Renders a scrollbar that allows the user to zoom and pan in the chart along its XAxis. It also allows you to render a
  small overview of the chart inside the brush that is always visible and shows the full data set so that the user can
  see where they are zoomed in.
</p>
<p>
  If a chart is synchronized with other charts using the <code>syncId</code> prop on the chart, the brush will also
  synchronize the zooming and panning between all synchronized charts.
