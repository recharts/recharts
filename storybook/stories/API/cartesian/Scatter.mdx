# Scatter
The Scatter component is different to all other cartesian components in that it does not require a dataKey to be set.
Without a dataKey, the xAxis and yAxis are used to determine the position of the scatter points, which both require a dataKey.

If the dataKey is set, and no xAxis or yAxis is set, the Scatter will use the dataKey to determine the y-Axis value of the scatter points, and the index of each data point on the xAxis.

## Parent Component

The Scatter can be used within a `<ScatterChart/>` or a `<ComposedChart/>`.

## Child component

The Scatter can be used with the following child components: `<Cell />`, `<LabelList/>` or a `<ErrorBar/>`

## Properties

Properties in the groups Other and Internal are not recommended to be used.

<Meta of={ComponentStories} />;
<ArgTypes of={ComponentStories} sort={'requiredFirst'} />;
<Stories />;
