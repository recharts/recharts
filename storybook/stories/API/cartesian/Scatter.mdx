# Scatter

The Scatter component is different to all other cartesian components in that it does not require a dataKey to be set.
Without a dataKey, the xAxis and yAxis are used to determine the position of the scatter points, which both require a dataKey.

If the dataKey is set, and no xAxis or yAxis is set, the Scatter will use the dataKey to determine the y-Axis value of the scatter points, and the index of each data point on the xAxis.
