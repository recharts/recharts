The edge bars are smaller than the radius value, in which case the bars at the edge get a lot of radius\nand the middle one gets a little bit of radius.\n\nYou may want to combine this with setting individual Bar components' radius to their own values for best effect.\n`Bar.radius` prop will round corners of individual bars, while `BarStack.radius` will round corners of the entire stack.\n\nIf you provide a single number, it applies to all four corners.\nIf you provide an array of four numbers, they apply to top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left corners respectively.",
