## Description

<p>The sunburst is a hierarchical chart, similar to a Treemap, plotted in polar coordinates.
Sunburst charts effectively convey the hierarchical relationships and proportions within each level.
It is easy to see all the middle layers in the hierarchy, which might get lost in other visualizations.
For some datasets, the radial layout may be more visually appealing and intuitive than a traditional Treemap.</p>
