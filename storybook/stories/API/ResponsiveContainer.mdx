## Description

<p>
  The <code>ResponsiveContainer</code> component is a container that adjusts its width and height based on the size of
  its parent element. It is used to create responsive charts that adapt to different screen sizes.
</p>
<p>
  This component uses the ResizeObserver API to monitor changes to the size of its parent element. If you need to
  support older browsers that do not support this API, you may need to include a polyfill.
