## Description

<p>Returns the offset of the chart in pixels.</p>
<p>Offset defines the blank space between the chart and the plot area.
This blank space is occupied by supporting elements like axes, legends, and brushes.</p>
<p>The offset includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Margins</li>
<li>Width and height of the axes</li>
<li>Width and height of the legend</li>
<li>Brush height</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in the margin alone, use useMargin instead.</p>
<p>The offset is independent of charts position on the page, meaning it does not change as the chart is scrolled or resized.</p>
<p>It is also independent of the scale and zoom, meaning that as the user zooms in and out,
the numbers will not change as the chart gets visually larger or smaller.</p>
<p>This hook must be used within a chart context (inside a <code>&lt;LineChart&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;BarChart&gt;</code>, etc.).
This hook returns <code>undefined</code> if used outside a chart context.</p>
