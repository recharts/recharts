# `useOffset`

The `useOffset` hook returns the offset of the chart in pixels.

The offset is the distance from the edges of the chart to the edges of the plot area.

Plot area is the area where the data is rendered, and shows the actual data points, bars, lines, etc.

The space between the plot area and the edges of the chart is used for axes, legends, and other supporting elements.

The offset includes:
- Margins
- Width and height of the axes
- Width and height of the legend
- Brush height

The offset is independent of charts position on the page, meaning it does not change as the chart is scrolled or resized.
