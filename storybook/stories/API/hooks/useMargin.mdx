# useMargin

A hook that returns the margin of the chart. The margin is an object with `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties.

Margin is the empty space around the chart. Excludes axes and legend and brushes and the like.

This is declared by the user in the chart props.

If you are interested in the space occupied by axes, legend, or brushes, use `useOffset` hook instead,
which also includes calculated widths and heights of axes and legends and so.

## Signature

```
import { useMargin } from 'recharts';
const margin = useMargin();
```

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.UseMargin} layout="padded" />
