# `useChartWidth`, `useChartHeight`

The `useChartWidth` hook returns the width of the chart in pixels. `useChartHeight` returns the height of the chart in pixels.

If you are using chart with hardcoded `width` and `height` props, then the width returned will be the same
as the `width` and `height` prop on the main chart element.

If you are using a chart with a `ResponsiveContainer`, the width and height will be the size of the chart
as the ResponsiveContainer has decided it would be.

If the chart has any axes or legend, the `width` and `height` will be the size of the chart
including the axes and legend.

The dimensions do not scale, meaning as user zoom in and out, the width/height number will not change
as the chart gets visually larger or smaller.
