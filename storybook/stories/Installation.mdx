# Installation

### NPM

NPM is the easiest and fastest way to get started using Recharts. It is also the recommended installation method when building single-page applications (SPAs). It pairs nicely with a CommonJS module bundler such as Webpack.

```bash
#latest stable
npm install recharts
```

### UMD

The UMD build is also available on unpkg.com ( unpkg ):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/prop-types/prop-types.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/recharts/umd/Recharts.js"></script>

```
You can find the library on window.Recharts
