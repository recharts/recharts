## Intro

Recharts is a **Redefined** chart library built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [D3](http://d3js.org).

The main purpose of this library is to help you to write charts in React applications without any pain. Main principles of Recharts are:

1. **Simply** deploy with React components
1. **Native** SVG support, lightweight depend on some D3 submodules
1. **Declarative** components, components of chart are purely presentational

## Examples

```jsx
<LineChart
  width={400}
  height={400}
  data={data}
  margin={{ top: 5, right: 20, left: 10, bottom: 5 }}
>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" />
  <Tooltip />
  <CartesianGrid stroke="#f5f5f5" />
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="uv" stroke="#ff7300" yAxisId={0} />
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#387908" yAxisId={1} />
</LineChart>
```

All the components of Recharts is clearly separated. The lineChart is composed by x axis, tooltip, grid, and line items, and each of them is an independent React Component. The clear separation and composition of components is one of the principle Recharts follow.

## Module Formats

- [babel-plugin-recharts](https://github.com/recharts/babel-plugin-recharts) A simple transform to cherry-pick Recharts modules so you donâ€™t have to.

## Contribution

We'd love :heart: to hear what you think we should build. Please create a issue to write your usage or ideas.

We are looking for like-minded people who share the same idea about Recharts. The goal of this project is create a more flexible charting library for the  React community.
