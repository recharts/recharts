## Introduction

Recharts is a **Redefined** chart library built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [D3](http://d3js.org).

The main purpose of this library is to help you to write charts in React applications without any pain. Main principles of Recharts are:

1. **Simply** deploy with React components.
2. **Native** SVG support, lightweight with minimal dependencies.
3. **Declarative** components.

Documentation at [recharts.org](https://recharts.org) and our [storybook](https://recharts.org/en-US/storybook)

Also see [the wiki](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/wiki).

All development is done on the `master` branch. The current latest release and storybook documentation reflects what is on the `release` branch.

## Examples

```jsx
<LineChart width={400} height={400} data={data}>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" />
  <Tooltip />
  <CartesianGrid stroke="#f5f5f5" />
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="uv" stroke="#ff7300" />
  <Line type="monotone" dataKey="pv" stroke="#387908" />
</LineChart>
```

All the components of Recharts are clearly separated. The LineChart is composed of x axis, tooltip, grid, and line items, and each of them is an independent React Component. The clear separation and composition of components is one of the principle Recharts follows.

## Installation

### npm

NPM is the easiest and fastest way to get started using Recharts. It is also the recommended installation method when building single-page applications (SPAs). It pairs nicely with a CommonJS module bundler such as Webpack.

```sh
# latest stable
$ npm install recharts react-is
```

`react-is` needs to match the version of your installed `react` package.

### umd

The UMD build is also available on unpkg.com:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-is/umd/react-is.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/recharts/umd/Recharts.min.js"></script>
```

Then you can find the library on `window.Recharts`.
